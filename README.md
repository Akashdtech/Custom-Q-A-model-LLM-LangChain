# Custom-Q-A-model-LLM-Langchain
This project demonstrates the creation of an intelligent question-answering pipeline using LangChain and FAISS for document retrieval and OpenAI for language generation. The workflow processes a CSV file containing Q&A data, builds a vector database for semantic search, and integrates a language model to answer questions based on the retrieved context. Below are the key steps included in the implementation:

    Setup and Dependencies:
        Install required libraries: langchain, langchain_community, faiss-cpu, and HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
        Configure API access with OpenAI for language model operations.

    Data Loading:
        Use the CSVLoader from LangChain to load a dataset containing questions and answers.
        Limit the dataset to 500 entries for processing.

    Text Splitting:
        Split documents into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to enable efficient context retrieval.

    Vector Database Creation:
        Generate document embeddings using HuggingFace models.
        Build a FAISS vector store for efficient semantic search and retrieval.

    Retriever Configuration:
        Convert the vector store into a retriever to enable context-aware querying.

    Prompt Engineering:
        Design a custom prompt template to ensure accurate and context-driven responses.

    Language Model Integration:
        Utilize OpenAI's language model to answer questions based on retrieved context.

    Question-Answering Pipeline:
        Create a RetrievalQA chain combining document retrieval and LLM for answering user queries.
        Example query: "What magazine rated Beyonce as the most powerful female musician in 2015?"

This pipeline highlights the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LangChain, vector search, and state-of-the-art LLMs for creating robust, context-aware QA systems.
