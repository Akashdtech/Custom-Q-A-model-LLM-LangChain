# Custom-Q-A-model-LLM-Langchain
This project demonstrates the creation of an intelligent question-answering pipeline using LangChain and FAISS for document retrieval, combined with a Hugging Face-hosted LLM for language generation. The workflow processes a CSV file containing Q&A data, builds a vector database for semantic search, and integrates a custom LLM to answer questions based on the retrieved context. Below are the key steps included in the implementation.

Setup and Dependencies:

    Install required libraries: langchain, langchain_community, faiss-cpu, and HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
    Configure API access with Hugging Face for language model operations.
    pip install langchain langchain_community faiss-cpu

Data Loading:

    Use CSVLoader from LangChain to load a dataset containing questions and answers.
    Limit the dataset to 500 entries for efficient processing.

Text Splitting:

    Split documents into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to enable efficient context retrieval.

Vector Database Creation:

    Generate document embeddings using Hugging Face models.
    Build a FAISS vector store for efficient semantic search and retrieval.

Retriever Configuration:

    Convert the vector store into a retriever to enable context-aware querying.

Prompt Engineering:

    Design a custom prompt template to ensure accurate and context-driven responses.

Language Model Integration:

    Utilize Hugging Face's Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to answer questions based on the retrieved context.

Question-Answering Pipeline:

    Create a RetrievalQA chain combining document retrieval and LLM generation for answering user queries.
    Example query: chain('What magazine rated Beyonce as the most powerful female musician in 2015?')

Key Features:

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for better answer accuracy.
    FAISS-powered semantic search for efficient document retrieval.
    Custom LLM integration using LangChain.
    Scalable and modular architecture for future expansion.

This pipeline highlights the seamless integration of retrieval-based search, vector databases, and state-of-the-art language models, making it a powerful solution for context-aware question-answering systems.
